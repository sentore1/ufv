**OUR PROGRAMS**

- **Justice Begans at Home ( Ubutabera Buhera mu Muryango)**

This initiative aims to promote justice, accountability, and nonviolence within families by increasing legal awareness, strengthening peaceful dialogue, and reinforcing the role of parents and leaders in protecting children.

This was due in our work different Districts; we have seen the everyday struggles families face:

- Family conflict and domestic violence
- Child neglect and abuse: where children are left unprotected in emotionally or physically unsafe homes.
- School dropouts and children going to the streets: caused in part by family instability, misunderstanding of parental responsibilities, and lack of legal knowledge.

These issues are not due to a lack of laws Rwanda's legal framework is strong. The problem is limited legal awareness, lack of conflict resolution tools, and community disengagement.

Justice Begins at Home" is a community-centered initiative designed to:

- - Empower families with legal knowledge about their rights and responsibilities.
    - Encourage peaceful conflict resolution within homes and relationships.

Prevent the suffering of children by strengthening parental roles and ensuring the involvement of local leaders in child protection

**Our Key Innovative Strategies and Activities**

We employ three primary tactics (our "3 pillars") in this initiative, each bold in its approach yet rooted

in local culture:

**Community-Based Legal Education - Inteko z'Abaturage**: We hold public legal education forums known as Inteko z'Abaturage in villages and neighborhoods.

**Confidential Counseling & Mediation for Families in Conflict**: We know that some wounds and grievances can't be addressed fully in a public forum.

**Partnering with Community Leaders to Strengthen Accountability**: We believe that local leaders (from village chiefs to members of Community Policing Committees) are essential allies in this movement.

**Our Impact So Far:  
**✅ 106 families supported to resolve conflicts in Kinyinya Sector  
✅ Legal awareness raised across all villages in Kinyinya, the most populated sector in Rwanda with over 125,000 people, through Inteko z'Abaturage, Imiganda, and other community platforms  
✅ 500+ local leaders trained on GBV and proper evidence handling  
✅ 15 secondary schools reached on GBV prevention in Gasabo District

- **Tumurere Yize Program**

At Helping Heart Family Rwanda, we believe that education is not a choice but a necessity, and that no child should be left behind. This is why we launched the Tumurere Yize Program, meaning "Let us raise them to learn." The initiative provides educational support to children who are often forgotten those from extremely poor families, orphans, children with disabilities, and street-connected children. Through advocacy and community engagement, we emphasize that everyone has a responsibility to prevent school dropouts and promote inclusive education.

**Our Achievements:**

- Over 500 children have received direct educational support, including school materials and learning resources.
- 60 children have been reunited with their families, reintegrated into school, and are now living safely and peacefully at home.
- We established an open library in Huye District, providing a supportive learning space for vulnerable children.

- **Mama youth empowerment**

**New life beginning**

At Helping Heart Family Rwanda, we believe that becoming a mother at a young age is not the end of life it can be a new beginning. Many teenage mothers face judgment, rejection, and hopelessness, but we stand with them. Through our Teen Mother Empowerment Program, we are committed to giving them a second chance and restoring their hope. Here's how we support them: We advocate for their legal rights, ensuring they receive justice and protection. We help them return to school, because education is the key to a better future. For those who can't go back to school, we support them to start small businesses, so they can earn a living and take care of their children.

**Mama Youth Empowerment, Impact**

Through the Mama Youth Empowerment Program, Helping Heart Family Rwanda is restoring hope, dignity, and opportunity to teenage mothers and young girls facing vulnerability. Our work focuses on rebuilding confidence, promoting SRHR knowledge, and creating pathways to education and economic independence.

Our Achievements:

- 45 teenage mothers have received direct support through counseling, skills-building, and mentorship.
- 10 young mothers were successfully reintegrated into school, giving them a second chance to pursue their education and future goals.
- 25 beneficiaries were supported to start small businesses, helping them regain financial stability and independence.
- We established a supportive Itsinda (peer support group) where members meet regularly to learn about Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR), share experiences, and build stronger support networks.

- **Mentorship and Youth empowerment**

At Helping Heart Family Rwanda, we believe that empowered youth are key to building stronger, safer, and more just communities. Our Mentorship and Youth Empowerment Program equip young people with the knowledge, skills, and confidence they need to become leaders, changemakers, and protectors of children's rights.

Through this program, we connect youth with trained mentors who guide them in personal development, leadership, life skills, and community service. We also provide workshops and trainings on topics such as gender equality, GBV prevention, legal awareness, mental health, digital skills, and entrepreneurship. By giving young people the right tools and supportive guidance, we help them take responsibility in their communities, become role models, and inspire others to make positive change.

This program ensures that youth are not only beneficiaries, but active contributors to building inclusive, informed, and empowered communities across Rwanda.

- **Drug Prevention and Reintegration Program**

At Helping Heart Family Rwanda, our Drug Prevention and Reintegration Program is designed to protect young people from the dangers of drug abuse while supporting those already affected to rebuild their lives. The program focuses on awareness, early intervention, rehabilitation support, and community reintegration.

We begin by conducting education and awareness campaigns in communities, schools, and youth spaces to inform young people and families about the risks of drug use and the legal consequences. We work closely with local leaders, parents, and youth groups to strengthen prevention at the community level.

For young people struggling with drug use, we provide guidance, counseling referrals, and family support, ensuring they receive the care and attention needed to recover. Our team helps families create safe, supportive home environments to prevent relapse.

The reintegration component focuses on helping affected youth return to their families, school, or positive community activities. We work with parents and local structures to ensure that each young person is accepted, supported, and given a second chance to rebuild their future.

Through this program, Helping Heart Family Rwanda is reducing vulnerability, restoring hope, and empowering communities to take responsibility for protecting their youth.

**Impact**

We supported 160 young people after rehabilitation and helped them reunite with their families. We also provided mental health support to those affected and used AI tools to guide and connect vulnerable youth to the help they need.

- **Kura neza Mwana program (Nurture the Child Well**)

The Kura Neza Mwana Program is Helping Heart Family Rwanda's community-based initiative designed to prevent and reduce child malnutrition by empowering parents and strengthening household nutrition practices. The program works by combining nutrition education, household food production, and community follow-up to ensure that vulnerable children grow healthy and strong.

We begin with community assessments to identify children suffering from malnutrition and understand the household food situation. Our nutritionists then provide practical education sessions for parents, teaching them how to prepare balanced meals, maintain proper hygiene, and use locally available foods to improve a child's diet.

To increase access to nutritious food, the program supports families to establish kitchen gardens that grow vegetables such as dodo, carrots, and onions. Each household with a malnourished child also receives one egg-laying chicken, ensuring that children get a reliable source of protein through the "One Egg per Child" approach.

Our team conducts regular home visits to monitor children's growth, mentor parents, and ensure gardens and poultry are well managed. We partner with community health workers and local leaders to strengthen mobilization, encourage behavior change, and promote long-term sustainability.
